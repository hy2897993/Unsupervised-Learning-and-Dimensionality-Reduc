# Unsupervised-Learning-and-Dimensionality-Reduction

In this report, I first used 2 clustering algorithms to cluster two datasets.

The clustering algorithms are:
- **Kmeans Clustering**
- **Expectation Maximization**

The two datasets are:
- **Speech Emotion Recognition**  
> Audio Data:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWsrN2Ep7x6lWqOXfr4rpKGYrJhWc8z7/view
- **Forest Cover Type**

> Data Set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype

Then, I applied the 4 dimensionality reduction algorithms to the 2 datasets and project the data to different dimensions. In the last, I ran the neural networks on one of the original datasets and the datasets I applied the dimensionality reduction algorithms on. In this part, I also treated the cluster label as a new feature and reran the neural network learner on the newly projected data.
